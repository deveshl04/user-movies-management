# user-movies-management
To create a simple GraphQL API for managing a list of movies using Node.js with the Apollo GraphQL library, PostgreSQL for data storage, and incorporating authentication and authorization, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Set up the project:**
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init` and follow the prompts.
   - Install the required dependencies: `npm install apollo-server apollo-server-express express graphql graphql-tools jsonwebtoken bcrypt pg dotenv`.

2. **Database Setup:**
   - Set up a PostgreSQL database to store user, movie, and review data.
   - Create tables in the database for users, movies, and reviews.
   - Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using a library like `pg` in your Node.js code.

3. **Implement User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Create user registration (SignUp) functionality to allow users to sign up with email and password. Hash the passwords using a library like `bcrypt`.
   - Implement user login functionality to authenticate users and provide a JWT token upon successful login.
   - Use JWT tokens for authentication by including them in the headers of requests to authenticate API requests.
   - Implement middleware to validate and decode the JWT token on each request to authorize access to protected routes.

4. **Create the GraphQL Schema:**
   - Define the GraphQL schema for movies and reviews, including all the required fields and types.
   - Implement queries and mutations for CRUD operations on movies and reviews.
   - Add input types and custom scalar types if required for search, sort, filter, and pagination functionality.

5. **Implement Resolvers:**
   - Create resolvers for each query and mutation defined in the schema.
   - Connect the resolvers to the PostgreSQL database using appropriate SQL queries or an ORM like Sequelize.

6. **Handle Error and Data Validation:**
   - Implement error handling logic to catch and handle any errors that occur during API requests.
   - Validate the data provided in the API requests to ensure it meets the required criteria.

7. **Set Up Git Version Control:**
   - Initialize a Git repository in your project directory using `git init`.
   - Add and commit your code changes regularly as you develop the API.

8. **Test and Debug:**
   - Test the API endpoints using a tool like GraphQL Playground or Postman.
   - Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing and development.

9. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement sort, filter, and pagination functionality for querying movies and reviews.
   - Add search functionality based on movie name or description.
   - Ensure that the logged-in user's review always stays on top when querying reviews.

Remember to regularly save and commit your code to version control, write tests to ensure functionality, and follow best practices for security and performance.

Please note that creating a full-fledged GraphQL API with all the specified features and requirements may take significant time and effort, and the above steps provide a high-level overview. The actual implementation and timeline may vary depending on your familiarity with the technologies and your development speed.
